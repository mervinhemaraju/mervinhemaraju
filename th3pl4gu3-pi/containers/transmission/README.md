# Transmission

This is the docker compose file to spin up the transmission container for my local Raspberry Pi's torrent client.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Github Repo to a safe location
2. Create a `.env` file with the below values

```
USERNAME="<USER"
PASSWORD="<PASSWORD>"
MAIN_TRANSMISSION_PATH="<>"
MAIN_MEDIA_PATH="<>"
```

3. Run the command `docker compose up -d`
