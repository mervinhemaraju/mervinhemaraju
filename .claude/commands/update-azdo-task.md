# Update Azure DevOps Task

## Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` (space-separated tokens):

- **`TASK_ID`** — first token, numeric (optional — see resolution rules below)
- **`SOURCE`** — next token, `context` or `diff` (optional; if omitted, task content is not updated)
- **`--pr`** — optional flag; if present, create an Azure DevOps PR after updating the task
- **`--base <branch>`** — optional; base branch for the PR (default: `main`)

**Resolving `TASK_ID`:**
1. If the first token is numeric, use it as `TASK_ID`.
2. Otherwise, scan the current conversation context for a task ID that was created or mentioned (e.g. from a prior `/create-azdo-task` run). Use that ID and tell the user which one you picked.
3. If no ID is found in context, ask the user: "Which task ID should I update?"

Stop with a usage message if `SOURCE` is present but not `context`/`diff`.

## Steps

### 1 — Resolve org + project

Check `AZDO_CLI_WORKITEMS_PAT` is set:

```bash
printenv AZDO_CLI_WORKITEMS_PAT | wc -c
```

If the byte count is 0 or 1 (empty or just a newline), stop and tell the user to export `AZDO_CLI_WORKITEMS_PAT` in `~/.zshenv` then restart Claude Code.

Verify Azure CLI credentials are valid:

```bash
az account show --output none
```

If this fails, stop and tell the user to run `azauth-dke` first, then retry.

Derive `AZDO_ORG` and `AZDO_PROJECT` from the git remote:

```bash
git remote get-url origin
```

Parse the URL: `https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_git/{repo}`
- `AZDO_ORG` = `https://dev.azure.com/{org}`
- `AZDO_PROJECT` = `{project}`

If the URL doesn't match this pattern or no remote is set, ask the user to provide the missing values before continuing.

### 1b — Show plan and wait for approval

Tell the user:
- Task ID that will be updated
- Whether discussion will be added (SOURCE provided or not)
- Whether a PR will be created (`--pr` flag)
- Base branch for PR (if applicable)

**Wait for the user to confirm. After confirmation, proceed with all remaining steps automatically without asking for further confirmation.**

### 2 — Gather context (skip if SOURCE was not provided)

- If `SOURCE` is `diff`: run `git diff` and `git diff --staged`. Analyze what changed — files, purpose, key decisions.
- If `SOURCE` is `context`: use what was discussed and implemented in the current conversation session.

From whichever source, produce:
- A 2–4 sentence summary of what was done and why.
- List of files changed (if applicable).
- Current branch name (run `git branch --show-current`).

### 3 — Update the task discussion (skip if SOURCE was not provided)

```bash
AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT="$AZDO_CLI_WORKITEMS_PAT" az boards work-item update --id $TASK_ID \
  --discussion "<summary of what was done>. Files: <list>. Branch: <branch>." \
  --organization "$AZDO_ORG" \
  --output none
```

### 4 — Create PR (only if --pr was passed)

Determine the base branch: use the value from `--base` if provided, otherwise `main`.

#### 4a — Find the PR template

```bash
find .azuredevops -name "*.md" | head -1
```

- If a file is found, read it. Fill in each section using the context from Step 2 (diff or session). Preserve the template structure exactly — do not add or remove sections.
- If no file is found, generate a standard PR template body from the Step 2 summary with sections: **Summary**, **Changes**, **Test plan**, and **Notes**.

Write the result to `/tmp/azdo_pr_body.md`.

#### 4b — Create the PR

```bash
AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT="$AZDO_CLI_WORKITEMS_PAT" az repos pr create \
  --title "<concise title derived from the task summary>" \
  --target-branch <base-branch> \
  --source-branch $(git branch --show-current) \
  --description "@/tmp/azdo_pr_body.md" \
  --organization "$AZDO_ORG" \
  --project "$AZDO_PROJECT" \
  --output json
```

Capture the `pullRequestId` field from the JSON output as `PR_ID`.

#### 4c — Link the PR to the work item

```bash
AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT="$AZDO_CLI_WORKITEMS_PAT" az repos pr work-item add \
  --id $PR_ID \
  --work-items $TASK_ID \
  --organization "$AZDO_ORG"
```

Print the PR URL from the JSON output in step 4b.

### 5 — Mark work item as Done

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
print(json.dumps([{'op':'add','path':'/fields/System.State','value':'Done'}]))
" > /tmp/azdo_state.json

curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(printf ':%s' "$AZDO_CLI_WORKITEMS_PAT" | base64)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json-patch+json" \
  --data-binary "@/tmp/azdo_state.json" \
  "$AZDO_ORG/$AZDO_PROJECT/_apis/wit/workitems/$TASK_ID?api-version=7.0"
```

### 6 — Output

Print the task URL: `$AZDO_ORG/$AZDO_PROJECT/_workitems/edit/$TASK_ID`
